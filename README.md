# Genetic Algorithms
My 8th grade daughter wanted to create a science display for school. Not a science fair, but somthing a small group could research, lean and present. After several discussions, we started looking at genetic algorithms with the thought "that's cool."

I offered to help them with the code, but they had to help with the broad design of their playground.  They decided on a trail their virtual bloodhound would have to find and follow. So here is the environment they created.

 * The bloodhoud could only tell if there was a scent marker directly in front.
 * Actions were limited to: turn left, turn right, go straight ahead, which we encoded as 'L', 'R', 'F'.

From here we talked about programing a state machine by use of a table of a fixed size.  We always started at location 0,0 looking towards (0,1) at state 0.  We used the following state table with a total of 24 different states to help the kids visualize how the process worked.

State | Action with scent | Action without scent | Next state
------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------
 0    | L, R, or F        | L, R, or F           | 0 - 23
 1    | L, R, or F        | L, R, or F           | 0 - 23
 ...  | L, R, or F        | L, R, or F           | 0 - 23
 23   | L, R, or F        | L, R, or F           | 0 - 23

Now each chromosone was a series of 24 [letter, letter, number]. We drew out some sample chromosones and talked about crossing two chromosones and using mutation as factors of creating new and possibly better chromosones.  Because they got bored after filling in a
state table at around state 7 and since the whole purpose was to let the computer create the solutions, we randomly created the chromosones.

Now each person had to provide the following for the command-line:

 * --gen: The maximum number of generations before stopping to find a solution.
 * --pop: The population size every generation.
 * --steps: Maximum number of actions before the fitness function quits.
 * --promote: Percent of top ranked population to keep.
 * --cross: Percent of next population by cross breeding the top ranked.
 * --mutate: Percent of top ranked population to mutate.
 * --rate: Probability to mutate an input state.
 * --action: Probability to mutate a state's action.
 * --state: Probability to mutate the next state action.

The results of these runs were kept in a SQLite database.  We kept a record of all our runs and saw that even with the same starting conditions, the end result would vary because of our use of randomly generated chromosones and mutation.

## Results

The computer would print out the number of actions before a solution was found which completed the scent trail.  The kids were a bit underwhelmed by just a number.  They needed some visualization.  I created `imager.py` which created a series of images showing how the
virtual bloodhound searched the field. They giving all these images to `image2gif`, I now had an image the kids could not only see, but use to demonstrate the outcome of some of their most successful and worst wonderings.
